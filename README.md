### About the Dataset :

National Football League (NFL) game results since 1966 with betting odds information since 1979. The dataset was created from a variety of sources including
games and scores from various public websites such as ESPN, NFL.com, and Pro Football Reference. Weather information is from NOAA data with NFLweather.com as a 
good cross reference. Betting data was used from http://www.repole.com/sun4cast/data.html for the 1978-2013 seasons. Pro-football-reference.com data was then 
cross-referenced for betting lines and odds as well as weather data. From 2013 betting data reflects lines available at sportsline.com and aussportsbetting.com.
